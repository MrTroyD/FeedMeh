Ludum Dare 46 game


I'm attempting to make and document this one properly. Chances are this document won't change at all ;)

Right now I'm trying to figure out the best possible use of the theme "Keep it Alive". As of right now the only idea that I have is to make a game that is a play off of Little Shop of Horror. You have a matter eatting plant that you have to bring it various things to eat. Depending on how you feed it, it'll change based off of that. The changes will all be based on colors and other simple things. Nothing too dramatic. If I can keep the shapes/art simple we should be good. :)
