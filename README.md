Ludum Dare 46 game


I'm attempting to make and document this one properly. ~Chances are this document won't change at all~ ;) How wrong you were Friday Troy :D

Right now I'm trying to figure out the best possible use of the theme "Keep it Alive". As of right now the only idea that I have is to make a game that is a play off of Little Shop of Horror. You have a matter eatting plant that you have to bring it various things to eat. ~Depending on how you feed it, it'll change based off of that. The changes will all be based on colors and other simple things. Nothing too dramatic.~ If I can keep the shapes/art simple we should be good. :)

Update:
HA! That was rich. The game still turned out to be rather complicated in the end. I tried using Paintshop Pro, and ended up spending too much time to get the effects that I want. I ended up making the game almost 100% of what I wanted besides all of the color changing stuff mentioned above. At the time of this writing, a few tweaks could allow for the above mentioned, but... I'm done.

I learned so much in building this I hope that I can make a 5 minute documentary on what my process was. I spent a majority of the weekend recording everything (with the exception of a few hours here and there, as well as all last minute stuff) so I have pleanty of assets to use for that.

Thanks for viewing! Let me know if you have any questions! @MrTroy on Twitter.
